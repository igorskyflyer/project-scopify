# Project SCOPIFY

♾️ Project SCOPIFY is a monthly effort to make my public scope npm modules private. 🔏

<br>

## 🔖 Description

`Project SCOPIFY` is all about making things simpler and more organized! It's an initiative that aims to improve the way my npm packages are named and organized by migrating them from unscoped to scoped names. By doing this, we can avoid any potential naming conflicts and make it easier for developers like you to find and use these packages in your projects.

<br>

## 🔮 The Vision

The idea behind `Project SCOPIFY` is to create a more cohesive and collaborative environment for everyone. I believe that by using scoped names, we can enhance the package management experience and promote better collaboration within the community. It's all about working together and making things more efficient for everyone involved.

<br>

## 🤔 How It Works

Here's how it works: I'll carefully plan and execute the migration process, ensuring that it doesn't cause any disruptions for current users. I'll keep you updated throughout the process, and you can count on me to provide clear guidelines and support for a smooth transition to the scoped packages.

## 🦩 Benefits

With `Project SCOPIFY`, you can expect a more organized and conflict-free package experience. No more worries about naming clashes or confusion when using my npm packages. It's all about simplifying things and making your life as a developer easier.
